In the "old mode", this pipeline runs at
a cool rate of 1 job every 3 cycles.

The main bottleneck is from the cycle

    source update trig -> source update compl -> target sample trig -> target sample compl
      ->o  source update trig.

which has a delay of 3 cycles.

By adding buffering to the target sample trig, we can reduce this
cycle delay to 2 cycles, and by adding a 2-marked reenable this
can lead to full rate performance.
