\lhead{Chapter 9. \emph{Conclusion $\&$ Future Work}}

Partitioning can help to improve the performance of the min sum decoding algorithm by a factor of n for a n-way partition. Still, the trade off between cost to performance exist as increasing the partitions costs almost 2.5xn times per n-way partitioning. Another way to reduce cost is to decrease floating point units but again time to decode suffers. 

The extension of the work can have different quantization levels of the floating point values and check for the trade off between accuracy of operation and error correcting threshold.  As the precision of floating point value is decreased the convergence of algorithm also suffers. Thus, to get a optimum precision that gives a desired error correction can be explored as the future work.
